Nimisha's Blog: Cutie and Pumpkin
</h1>

<h3>Hey! My name is Nimisha Bora, and I have the cutest little doggos in the neighborhood! I let them take it away...</h3>

<h2 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Cutie (Bootlu) Bora</h2>

<p>Hello all! My name is Cutie and I am a little Shih Tzu dog. I am seven years old. Some of my hobbies are barking at <br>squirrels and deer, 
playing with and getting attention from my amazing humans, and intimidating other dogs. I love <br>to play with my kid humans and little 
sister, Pumpkin, above everything else. Here are some pictures and videos of me!<br>

<p>Hiii everybody! You guessed it, I'm Pumpkin! I'm four years old and I'll use any chance I can get for some bellyscratch. <br>I love to play with 
everyone, say 'Hi!' to random people, and again, I LOVE BELLYSCRATCHES! My human people are <br>the best because the they love me even if I make a 
mistake on the carpet. Here are some pitures and videos of me:<br>
